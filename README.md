# Library-Management-System

Hi!, welcome to my repository. The **Library Management System (LMS)** is developed for transforming manual offline workload into online automatic system. It contains all the main 
features such as adding and managing students, books with efficiently maintaining their data. It also contains other security features such as **Captcha Verification** and 
**Password Encryption**. This is a complete LMS with all the necessary functionalties. It also provides feature to **generate report** and **manage fine**.

Note: This is an extended version of Library Management System that can be found [here](https://phpgurukul.com/online-library-management-system/). I have added more advance functionalities like **report generation**.
